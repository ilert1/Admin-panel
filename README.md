# Advanced Admin Panel — React + TypeScript

A fully featured and scalable admin panel built with **TypeScript, React, and TailwindCSS**.  
The application provides a rich interface for managing complex data entities, including filtering, sorting, advanced search, and dynamic forms.

This project is based on **React-Admin**, extended with a range of modern tools and architectural improvements.

## 🧩 Custom Contributions

I personally implemented and introduced:

### ✔ Custom Shadcn UI Sheet Manager Hook
A reusable custom hook for managing Sheet components from Shadcn UI.  
It was extracted into a standalone open-source package and published on:

- **GitHub**  
- **npm**

This hook is used throughout the project to simplify Sheet state management and improve UI consistency.
